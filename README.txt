# Our goal in this project is to predict the binary Status of heart disease from 
# the other features available, with particular interest in seeing if our new assay is predictive 
# of disease or not. A good model here will both predict well and give your colleague
# an effect of the predictive power of this new assay.
#
# Our features (which have all been standardized) are:
#   
# old_assay: a previous biological measurement used to predict this disease;
# gold_standard: standard-of-care predictive score for this disease;
# assay: a new assay developed in lab you are working with.
# BP: a measure of blood pressure;
# smoking: a measure of cumulative tobacco use;
# alcohol: a measure of alcohol consumption;
# cholesterol: a measure of cholesterol;
# behavior: a behavioral measure measuring risk for this disease;
# BMI: standardized body mass index;
# age: subject age
